todo-app-dbb
============

The todo-app-dbb repo is a copy of the [todo-app-classic](https://github.com/sparksmb/todo-app-classic) with an aim to implement declarative behavior binding.  The idea is to push all the view code that adds no value or logic to the application down into the framework.  This glue code can essentially be coded into a repeatable mechanism that lives in the view module.  

Please see [wiki Home](https://github.com/sparksmb/todo-app-dbb/wiki) for more detail and background.
